    "### Wage Data Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "The **wage data** in this dataset tracks changes in compensation for workers in the technology industry over time. The dataset includes data on **total compensation**, **wages and salaries**, and **benefits** for workers in the private sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Wage Value**: Represents the average compensation for workers in the technology industry during a given period. The value is presented in terms of dollars per hour worked.\n",
    "  - For example, if the **wage value** is **$50**, it means that, on average, workers in the technology sector earned $50 per hour during that quarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Uses of Wage Data**:\n",
    "  - **Tracking Wage Inflation**: This dataset allows for the calculation of wage inflation (percentage change in wages) over time, helping to assess whether compensation is keeping up with the cost of living.\n",
    "  - **Labor Market Trends**: Wage data helps to identify trends in the labor market, including which industries are experiencing wage growth or stagnation.\n",
    "  - **Economic Policy**: Wage growth is often used as an indicator of labor market health, and is monitored by policymakers for decisions on employment and economic growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this dataset, the wage data is broken down into specific categories:\n",
    "- **Total Compensation**: Includes wages, salaries, and benefits.\n",
    "- **Wages and Salaries**: Excludes benefits and focuses solely on direct pay.\n",
    "- **Benefits**: Tracks the value of non-wage compensation, such as health insurance and retirement benefits.\n"
